# Advent of Code (AoC)

My personal repo for all my AoC solutions.

The repo is organized as follows: 
```
year/
    ├── day/
    │   ├── programming-language/
    │   └── data/
```

## Commands

Below are some useful commands for working with this repo:

- **install**: Installs dependencies for the project.
- **test**: Runs all available tests for the solutions.
- **format**: Formats the code according to style guidelines.
- **check**: Runs test and format 

You can also scope any of the commands to a specific programming language by appending a colon and the language name, for example `test:python` or `test:typescript`.

## Notes on AI Usage

I do not use AI coding tools to solve puzzles in this repo. The purpose of this repo is for personal practice and to test **MY** knowledge. I also refrain from referencing programming language documentation as much as I can, since I find it more valuable when I recall the information on my own.
